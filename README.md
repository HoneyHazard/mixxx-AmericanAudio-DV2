Mixxx controller mapping for American Audio DV2 mixer controller

Changelog
=======================

Version 0.1 released 9/26/2014:
* Most of LEDs and buttons on the top surface are utilized
* Microphone trebble and bass knobs are not utilized due to not having direct analogues inside mixxx (as far as I can tell)
* "G" START switches are not utilized as they are not MIDI-accessible
* PGM, reverse, cross-fader tuning controls on the front panel are currently not utilized (will be hard to emulate with scripts and very limited use, as far as I can tell)

Installation
=======================

Copy the files into controller mapping files folder, as specified in the wiki: http://mixxx.org/wiki/doku.php/midi_controller_mapping_file_format
